Strategic Design:
1) MineField
2) Cell
3) Player




Tactical Design:
1) Task list of test cases
-> Player makes a move on the mineField
-> Mine explodes
-> An adjacent cell tells the number of mines surrounding it
-> A player should be able to seal a cell
-> Once the game ends, the player should know the result as a prompt
-> Once the game ends, the player should not be able to make another move
-> Only an unexposed cell can be sealed
-> Only an unexposed and unsealed cell can be exposed
-> Exposing a mined cell should end the game
-> When an empty cell is exposed, it will expose all of its unexposed adjacent cells



Tactical Design:
Task List Of Features -> Test Case of Simplest Feature -> Minimal Impl -> Update Strategic Design

1) Should be able to expose a tile
2) Tile should display a number of adjacent tiles who have mines
3) A person who opens mined tile game should end
4) When game opens, a random minefield should be setup
5) Game should have second turn
6) Game should check after every turn if entire mineField has been exposed or not
7) There should be a mineField
8) A player should be able to seal a cell
9) A player shouldn't able to seal an exposed cell
10) A player can unseal a cell



Principles to keep in mind:
YAGNIy—You Aren't Gonna Need It (yet)
Last Responsible Moment
DRY—Don't Repeat Yourself
SLAP—Single Level of Abstraction Principle
SRP—Single Responsibility Principle


2) Design update based on test cases
