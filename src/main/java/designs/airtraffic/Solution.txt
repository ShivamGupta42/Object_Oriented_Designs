FR:
1) Single runway
2) Multiple flights
3) Schedule for one week  - (dynamically receive request)

NFR:
1)alerts
2)performant
3)reliable




Strategic Design:
Flight - (takingOffTime, landingTime, onRunwayTime, Arrival/Departure)
Runway - (Flight)
Scheduler Thread-
             - synchronized acceptRequests()
                -> Maintains Tree-Set of all intervals
                 -> has the interval overlap logic
                 -> Based on Arrival/Departure adds an interval into the Treeset
            - run() (Thread main method)
            - getNextFlight()
                 -> polls() the flights which have taken off
            - checkFlightOnRunway(LocalDateTime futureTime)
              - queries the Treeset for an interval equal or greater than futureTime and returns response



Interval  - (startTime/EndTime)
          - implements a comprable interface
          - Comparator ->   (a,b) -> a.startTime - b.startTime;
