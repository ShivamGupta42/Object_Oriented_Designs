Strategic Design: ( classes and their relationships only)
1) Elevator management System
2) Elevators


Tactical Design (concrete implementations):
Task List of Features -> Pick simplest features -> Write test case -> Write minimum implementation -> Update strategic design
1) When EMS comes up, all elevators are instantiated.
2) A person should be able to request an elevator
